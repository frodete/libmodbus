modbus_reply_callback(3)
========================

NAME
----
modbus_reply_callback - invoke a callback and send a reponse to the received request


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int modbus_reply_callback(modbus_t *'ctx', const uint8_t *'req', int 'req_length', modbus_callbacks_t *'mb_callbacks', void *'user_data');


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *modbus_reply_callback()* function is modelled on and takes much the same
parameters as *modbus_reply()*. It is designed for more complex situations
where actions are needed to be performed instead of reading or writing to
a Modbus mapping.

Based on the request *modbus_reply_callback()* shall invoke a callback and
send a response to the received request. The request _req_ given
as argument is analyzed, a callback is invoked, and a response is then built
and sent by using the information of the modbus context _ctx_.

For read functions, the callback will need to supply the response, returning
the length of that response. For pure write functions (i.e. not
MODBUS_FC_WRITE_AND_READ_REGISTERS), the response is automatically constructed.

The callbacks are supplied in an array of callbacks _mb_callbacks_ indexed by
the requested function. If a callback is not provided for a given function,
*modbus_reply_callback()* constructs the exception
MODBUS_EXCEPTION_ILLEGAL_FUNCTION accordingly. 

It is the callback's responsibility to return the Modbus error code
*negated* (except for the case where the operation is
MODBUS_FC_WRITE_SINGLE_COIL and the value is neither OFF nor ON) in case of
errors. In this case an exception response will be sent.

Note: If the return value is => 0 it is assumed that the call was successful
both for read and write callbacks. For read callbacks the value is also used
as the response length supplied by the callback function.

An optional parameter _user_data_ can be suppied which will be passed to
the callback function, typically for context purpose.

The callbacks have the following prototype:

int (*modbus_callback)(uint16_t addr, uint16_t nb, uint8_t *msg, void *user_data);

Each callback function takes the address (_addr_), number of registers
(_nb_), address to request/response message (_msg_), and pointer to optional
user data (_user_data_). The read response is pre-filled with the MBAP header
and FCode (function code), 8 bytes in total. The callback is responsible for
filling in the rest of the response PDU according to Modbus Application Protocol
V1.1b3, returning the size of the PDU.

This function is designed for Modbus server.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The function shall return the length of the response sent if
successful. Otherwise it shall return -1 and set errno.


ERRORS
------
*EMBMDATA*::
Sending has failed

See also the errors returned by the syscall used to send the response (eg. send
or write).

EXAMPLE
-------
[source,c]
-------------------
static modbus_callbacks_t callbacks;
int my_read_coil_implementation(uint16_t addr, uint16_t nb, uint8_t *rsp, void *user_data);
...

callbacks[MODBUS_FC_READ_COILS] = &my_read_coil_implementation;
...

modbus_reply_callback(context, &request, request_lenght, &callbacks, NULL);
